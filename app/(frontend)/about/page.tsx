                      . This course allowed me to immerse myself in interactive digital media production, covering
                      topics from web design, mobile interface design, front-end development, user testing, interface
                      design, digital storytelling, and more.

                      Upon graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic, I took a step back to reflect on my career path.
                      Exploring various roles and opportunities allowed me to contemplate my passion. It was in late
                      2022 that I decided to dive deeper into website development, aiming to leverage my digital media
                      skills to develop interactive websites and apps.

                    <p>
                      I discovered my preference for development over design. Design was not engaging for me, and trying
                      to do both was overwhelming as a new developer. While my education covered development principles,
                      I lacked foundational programming knowledge. Turning to{" "}

                      , I spent a year improving my development skills. This journey provided me invaluable insights and
                      helped me hone my coding abilities by teaching me webpage construction and getting involved in
                      contributions to open-source projects. It was a challenging but rewarding process that boosted my
                      capabilities and engagement.

                      In September 2023, my dedication paid off when I landed a position as a website developer at
                      Humber College. This marked a significant milestone in my career, as all my hard work had paid
                      off. During my time at Humber, I used my technical skills and improved my interpersonal skills.
                      Over nine months, my department provided a collaborative environment where I worked on
                      communication skills, project management abilities, and comfort with cross-functional teams, among
                      other things.

                    <p>
                      I found deep satisfaction in website development. Each project brought a fresh challenge and fed
                      that itch of continuous learning, inspiring me to explore new possibilities in this ever-evolving
                      field.
