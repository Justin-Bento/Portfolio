                My journey in web development began at Humber College. During my time at Humber, I studied

                . This course allowed me to immerse myself in interactive digital media production, covering topics from
                web design, mobile interface design, front-end development, user testing, interface design, digital
                storytelling, and more.

                Upon graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic, I took a step back to reflect on my career path. Exploring
                various roles and opportunities allowed me to contemplate my passion. It was in late 2022 that I decided
                to dive deeper into website development, aiming to leverage my digital media skills to develop
                interactive websites and apps.

                I discovered my preference for development over design. Design was not engaging for me, and trying to do
                both was overwhelming as a new developer. While my education covered development principles, I lacked
                foundational programming knowledge. Turning to

                , I spent a year improving my development skills. This journey provided me invaluable insights and
                helped me hone my coding abilities by teaching me webpage construction and getting involved in
                contributions to open-source projects. It was a challenging but rewarding process that boosted my
                capabilities and engagement.

                In September 2023, my dedication paid off when I landed a position as a website developer at Humber
                College. This marked a significant milestone in my career, as all my hard work had paid off. During my
                time at Humber, I used my technical skills and improved my interpersonal skills. Over nine months, my
                department provided a collaborative environment where I worked on communication skills, project
                management abilities, and comfort with cross-functional teams, among other things.

                I found deep satisfaction in website development. Each project brought a fresh challenge and fed that
                itch of continuous learning, inspiring me to explore new possibilities in this ever-evolving field.
