# Portfolio.

Portfolio is Justin Bento's main repository that hosts all the files for my website. This website is based on the React eacosystem using Sanity as the content management System. The goal of my portfolio is to tell the story of how each project came to be. By focusing on the journey, challenges, and insights gained throughout the design, and development process.
