# Justin Bento's Personal Website.

Hi üëã, I'm Justin Bento. A Full Stack JavaScript Developer based in Toronto, Ontario and welcome to my portfolio. üë®‚Äçüíª All of my projects are available on this website or my GitHub.

## Project Description

Welcome to my personal website. Here is where I upload and share all my design and development projects during my education, freelance and self-study. My motivation for building this website is transforming it into a creative outlet for me. 

Some challenges I faced when building this website include:

* Personal branding and content creation.
* Learning how to connect the Sanity Content Management System.
* Familiarizing myself with animation with JavaScript and tailwind
