# Welcome To My Portfolio 

I value simplicity, functionality, and intuitive design in every project. With a focus on web development and an interest in both frontend and backend, I’m continuously refining my skills and experimenting with new tools, like Next.js, React Native, TypeScript and more. This portfolio showcases a selection of my work, highlighting both personal and professional projects. Iniside this project you’ll find my experiences as a developer, documenting the skills and problem-solving approaches I've learned along the way.
